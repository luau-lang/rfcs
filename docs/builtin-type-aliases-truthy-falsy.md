# Builtin Truthy & Falsy Type Aliases

## Summary

add built-in type aliases `truthy` and `falsy` and update analysis stringification for these representations

## Motivation

its very inconvenient to type `~(false?)` (truthy) / `false?` (falsy)

currently this requires type functions but im going to larp negation syntax existing for the sake of this rfc

## Design

see [Summary](#Summary).

## Drawbacks

- no drawbacks

## Alternatives

- do nothing. this would make many people very sad, see [2516](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/issues/2516)
